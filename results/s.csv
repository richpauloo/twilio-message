"
"445","Matthew 17:7 
 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.

"
"447","Matthew 17:9

"
"452","Matthew 17:20 
 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. 
"
"453","Matthew 17:22 
 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men: 
"
"454","Matthew 17:25 
 He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers? 
"
"455","Matthew 17:26 
 Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.

"
"458","Matthew 18:22

"
"459","Matthew 19:1 
 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan; 
"
"460","Matthew 19:14 
 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. 
"
"461","Matthew 19:18 
 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, 
"
"462","Matthew 19:21 
 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me. 
"
"463","Matthew 19:23 
 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
"
"464","Matthew 19:26 
 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. 
"
"465","Matthew 19:28 
 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
"
"466","Matthew 20:17 
 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them, 
"
"467","Matthew 20:22 
 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able. 
"
"468","Matthew 20:25 
 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. 
"
"469","Matthew 20:30 
 And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David. 
"
"470","Matthew 20:32 
 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you? 
"
"471","Matthew 20:34

"
"472","Matthew 21:1 
 And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, 
"
"473","Matthew 21:6

"
"474","Matthew 21:11 
 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. 
"
"475","Matthew 21:12

"
"476","Matthew 21:16 
 And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise? 
"
"477","Matthew 21:21 
 Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done. 
"
"478","Matthew 21:24 
 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things. 
"
"479","Matthew 21:27 
 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. 
"
"480","Matthew 21:31 
 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. 
"
"481","Matthew 21:42 
 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? 
"
"482","Matthew 22:1 
 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said, 
"
"483","Matthew 22:18 
 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? 
"
"484","Matthew 22:29 
 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. 
"
"485","Matthew 22:37 
 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. 
"
"486","Matthew 22:41 
 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 
"
"487","Matthew 23:1 
 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, 
"
"488","Matthew 24:1 
 And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple. 
"
"489","Matthew 24:2 
 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. 
"
"490","Matthew 24:4 
 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 
"
"491","Matthew 26:1 
 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, 
"
"492","Matthew 26:4 
 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. 
"
"493","Matthew 26:6 
 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 
"
"494","Matthew 26:10 
 When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. 
"
"495","Matthew 26:17 
 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? 
"
"496","Matthew 26:19 
 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. 
"
"497","Matthew 26:26 
 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. 
"
"498","Matthew 26:31 
 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. 
"
"499","Matthew 26:34 
 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
"
"500","Matthew 26:36 
 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. 
"
"501","Matthew 26:49 
 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. 
"
"502","Matthew 26:50 
 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him. 
"
"503","Matthew 26:51 
 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. 
"
"504","Matthew 26:52 
 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. 
"
"505","Matthew 26:55 
 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. 
"
"506","Matthew 26:57 
 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. 
"
"507","Matthew 26:59 
 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; 
"
"508","Matthew 26:63 
 But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. 
"
"509","Matthew 26:64 
 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. 
"
"510","Matthew 26:69 
 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. 
"
"511","Matthew 26:71 
 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. 
"
"512","Matthew 26:75 
 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. 
"
"513","Matthew 27:1 
 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: 
"
"514","Matthew 27:11

"
"515","Matthew 27:17

"
"547","Mark 5:7

"
"548","Mark 5:13

"
"549","Mark 5:15 
 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. 
"

"
"563","Mark 8:27

"
"564","Mark 9:2

"
"566","Mark 9:5

"
"567","Mark 9:8 
 And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.

"
"571","Mark 9:39

"
"572","Mark 10:5 
 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept. 
"
"573","Mark 10:14

"
"574","Mark 10:18 
 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God. 
"
"575","Mark 10:21 
 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me. 
"
"576","Mark 10:23 
 And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 
"
"577","Mark 10:24 
 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! 
"
"578","Mark 10:27 
 And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible. 
"
"579","Mark 10:29 
 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, 
"
"580","Mark 10:32 
 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him, 
"
"581","Mark 10:38 
 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? 
"
"582","Mark 10:39 
 And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized: 
"
"583","Mark 10:42

"
"584","Mark 10:47 
 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me. 
"
"585","Mark 10:49 
 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee. 
"
"586","Mark 10:50 
 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. 
"
"587","Mark 10:51 
 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight. 
"
"588","Mark 10:52 
 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way. 
"
"589","Mark 11:6 
 And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go. 
"
"590","Mark 11:7

"
"591","Mark 11:11

"
"593","Mark 11:15

"
"594","Mark 11:22 
 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. 
"
"595","Mark 11:29 
 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. 
"
"596","Mark 11:33 
 And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. 
"
"597","Mark 12:17 
 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him. 
"
"598","Mark 12:24 
 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? 
"
"599","Mark 12:29 
 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: 
"
"600","Mark 12:34 
 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question. 
"
"601","Mark 12:35 
 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David? 
"
"602","Mark 12:41 
 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. 
"
"603","Mark 13:2 
 And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. 
"
"604","Mark 13:5 
 And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you: 
"
"605","Mark 14:6 
 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me. 
"
"606","Mark 14:18 
 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me. 
"
"607","Mark 14:22

"
"608","Mark 14:27

"
"609","Mark 14:30 
 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
"
"610","Mark 14:48 
 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me? 
"
"611","Mark 14:53 
 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes. 
"
"612","Mark 14:55 
 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none. 
"
"613","Mark 14:60 
 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? 
"
"614","Mark 14:62 
 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. 
"
"615","Mark 14:67 
 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. 
"
"616","Mark 14:72

"
"617","Mark 15:1 
 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. 
"
"618","Mark 15:5 
 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled. 
"
"619","Mark 15:15 
 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. 
"
"620","Mark 15:34 
 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
"
"621","Mark 15:37 
 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. 
"
"622","Mark 15:43

"
"623","Mark 16:6

"

"
"632","Luke 4:1

"
"633","Luke 4:4

"
"634","Luke 4:8

"
"641","Luke 5:12 
 And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
"
"642","Luke 5:19 
 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus. 
"
"643","Luke 5:22 
 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts? 
"
"644","Luke 5:31 
 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. 
"
"645","Luke 6:3 
 And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him; 
"
"646","Luke 6:9 
 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it? 
"
"647","Luke 6:11 
 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus. 
"
"648","Luke 7:3

"
"649","Luke 7:4

"
"650","Luke 7:6 
 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: 
"
"651","Luke 7:9

"
"652","Luke 7:19 
 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? 
"
"653","Luke 7:22

"
"654","Luke 7:37

"
"656","Luke 8:28

"
"657","Luke 8:30 
 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him. 
"
"658","Luke 8:35 
 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. 
"
"659","Luke 8:38 
 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, 
"
"660","Luke 8:39 
 Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him. 
"
"661","Luke 8:40

"
"662","Luke 8:41 
 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house: 
"
"663","Luke 8:45 
 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? 
"
"664","Luke 8:46 
 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me. 
"
"665","Luke 8:50 
 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole. 
"
"666","Luke 9:33 
 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said. 
"
"667","Luke 9:36 
 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen. 
"
"668","Luke 9:41 
 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither. 
"
"669","Luke 9:42 
 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father. 
"
"670","Luke 9:43 
 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples, 
"
"671","Luke 9:47 
 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him, 
"
"672","Luke 9:50 
 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us. 
"
"673","Luke 9:58

"
"674","Luke 9:60

"
"675","Luke 9:62 
 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. 
"
"676","Luke 10:21 
 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. 
"
"677","Luke 10:29 
 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour? 
"
"678","Luke 10:30 
 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. 
"
"679","Luke 10:37 
 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. 
"
"680","Luke 10:39 
 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word. 
"
"681","Luke 10:41 
 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: 
"
"682","Luke 13:2 
 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things? 
"
"683","Luke 13:12 
 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. 
"
"684","Luke 13:14 
 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day. 
"
"685","Luke 14:3 
 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? 
"
"686","Luke 17:13 
 And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. 
"
"687","Luke 17:17 
 And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? 
"
"688","Luke 18:16 
 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. 
"
"689","Luke 18:19 
 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God. 
"
"690","Luke 18:22 
 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. 
"
"691","Luke 18:24 
 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 
"
"692","Luke 18:37 
 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. 
"
"693","Luke 18:38 
 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me. 
"
"694","Luke 18:40 
 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, 
"
"695","Luke 18:42 
 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee. 
"
"696","Luke 19:1 
 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. 
"
"697","Luke 19:3 
 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature. 
"
"698","Luke 19:5 
 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. 
"
"699","Luke 19:9 
 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham. 
"
"700","Luke 19:35 
 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon. 
"
"701","Luke 20:8 
 And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. 
"
"702","Luke 20:34 
 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage: 
"
"703","Luke 22:47 
 And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. 
"
"704","Luke 22:48 
 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? 
"
"705","Luke 22:51 
 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. 
"
"706","Luke 22:52 
 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves? 
"
"707","Luke 22:63 
 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him. 
"
"708","Luke 23:8 
 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. 
"
"709","Luke 23:20 
 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. 
"
"710","Luke 23:25 
 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will. 
"
"711","Luke 23:26 
 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus. 
"
"712","Luke 23:28 
 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. 
"
"713","Luke 23:34 
 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. 
"
"714","Luke 23:42 
 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. 
"
"715","Luke 23:43 
 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. 
"
"716","Luke 23:46 
 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost. 
"
"717","Luke 23:52 
 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. 
"
"718","Luke 24:3 
 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. 
"
"719","Luke 24:15 
 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. 
"
"720","Luke 24:19 
 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: 
"
"721","Luke 24:36 
 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. 
"
"722","John 1:17 
 For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. 
"
"723","John 1:29 
 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. 
"
"724","John 1:36 
 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God! 
"
"725","John 1:37 
 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 
"
"726","John 1:38 
 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? 
"
"727","John 1:42 
 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone. 
"
"728","John 1:43 
 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. 
"
"729","John 1:45 
 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. 
"
"730","John 1:47 
 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! 
"
"731","John 1:48 
 Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. 
"
"732","John 1:50 
 Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. 
"
"733","John 2:1 
 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: 
"
"734","John 2:2 
 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. 
"
"735","John 2:3 
 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. 
"
"736","John 2:4 
 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. 
"
"737","John 2:7 
 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. 
"
"738","John 2:11 
 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. 
"
"739","John 2:13 
 And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
"
"740","John 2:19 
 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. 
"
"741","John 2:22 
 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. 
"
"742","John 2:24 
 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, 
"
"743","John 3:2 
 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. 
"
"744","John 3:3 
 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. 
"
"745","John 3:5 
 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 
"
"746","John 3:10 
 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? 
"
"747","John 3:22 
 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. 
"
"748","John 4:1 
 When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, 
"
"749","John 4:2 
 (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) 
"
"750","John 4:6 
 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. 
"
"751","John 4:7 
 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. 
"
"752","John 4:10 
 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. 
"
"753","John 4:13 
 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 
"
"754","John 4:16 
 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 
"
"755","John 4:17 
 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: 
"
"756","John 4:21 
 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. 
"
"757","John 4:26 
 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. 
"
"758","John 4:34 
 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. 
"
"759","John 4:44 
 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. 
"
"760","John 4:46 
 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. 
"
"761","John 4:47 
 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. 
"
"762","John 4:48 
 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. 
"
"763","John 4:50 
 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. 
"
"764","John 4:53 
 So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. 
"
"765","John 4:54 
 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee. 
"
"766","John 5:1 
 After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
"
"767","John 5:6 
 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? 
"
"768","John 5:8 
 Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. 
"
"769","John 5:13 
 And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. 
"
"770","John 5:14 
 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. 
"
"771","John 5:15 
 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. 
"
"772","John 5:16 
 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. 
"
"773","John 5:17 
 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. 
"
"774","John 5:19 
 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. 
"
"775","John 6:1 
 After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. 
"
"776","John 6:3 
 And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. 
"
"777","John 6:5 
 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? 
"
"778","John 6:10 
 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. 
"
"779","John 6:11 
 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. 
"
"780","John 6:14 
 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world. 
"
"781","John 6:15 
 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone. 
"
"782","John 6:17 
 And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. 
"
"783","John 6:19 
 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid. 
"
"784","John 6:22 
 The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone; 
"
"785","John 6:24 
 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus. 
"
"786","John 6:26 
 Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. 
"
"787","John 6:29 
 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. 
"
"788","John 6:32 
 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. 
"
"789","John 6:35 
 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. 
"
"790","John 6:42 
 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven? 
"
"791","John 6:43 
 Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves. 
"
"792","John 6:53 
 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. 
"
"793","John 6:61 
 When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you? 
"
"794","John 6:64 
 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. 
"
"795","John 6:67 
 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? 
"
"796","John 6:70 
 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? 
"
"797","John 7:1 
 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. 
"
"798","John 7:6 
 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. 
"
"799","John 7:14 
 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. 
"
"800","John 7:16 
 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. 
"
"801","John 7:21 
 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. 
"
"802","John 7:28 
 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. 
"
"803","John 7:33 
 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. 
"
"804","John 7:37 
 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. 
"
"805","John 7:39 
 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) 
"
"806","John 7:50 
 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) 
"
"807","John 8:1 
 Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 
"
"808","John 8:6 
 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. 
"
"809","John 8:9 
 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. 
"
"810","John 8:10 
 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? 
"
"811","John 8:11 
 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. 
"
"812","John 8:12 
 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 
"
"813","John 8:14 
 Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. 
"
"814","John 8:19 
 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. 
"
"815","John 8:20 
 These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come. 
"
"816","John 8:21 
 Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. 
"
"817","John 8:25 
 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning. 
"
"818","John 8:28 
 Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. 
"
"819","John 8:31 
 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; 
"
"820","John 8:34 
 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. 
"
"821","John 8:39 
 They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. 
"
"822","John 8:42 
 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. 
"
"823","John 8:49 
 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. 
"
"824","John 8:54 
 Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: 
"
"825","John 8:58 
 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. 
"
"826","John 8:59 
 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by. 
"
"827","John 9:1 
 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. 
"
"828","John 9:3 
 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. 
"
"829","John 9:11 
 He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. 
"
"830","John 9:14 
 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. 
"
"831","John 9:35 
 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? 
"
"832","John 9:37 
 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. 
"
"833","John 9:39 
 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. 
"
"834","John 9:41 
 Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth. 
"
"835","John 10:6 
 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. 
"
"836","John 10:7 
 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. 
"
"837","John 10:23 
 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. 
"
"838","John 10:25 
 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. 
"
"839","John 10:32 
 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? 
"
"840","John 10:34 
 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? 
"
"841","John 11:4 
 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. 
"
"842","John 11:5 
 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. 
"
"843","John 11:9 
 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. 
"
"844","John 11:13 
 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. 
"
"845","John 11:14 
 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. 
"
"846","John 11:17 
 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. 
"
"847","John 11:20 
 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. 
"
"848","John 11:21 
 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 
"
"849","John 11:23 
 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. 
"
"850","John 11:25 
 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: 
"
"851","John 11:30 
 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. 
"
"852","John 11:32 
 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 
"
"853","John 11:33 
 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled. 
"
"854","John 11:35 
 Jesus wept. 
"
"855","John 11:38 
 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. 
"
"856","John 11:39 
 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days. 
"
"857","John 11:40 
 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? 
"
"858","John 11:41 
 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. 
"
"859","John 11:44 
 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. 
"
"860","John 11:45 
 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him. 
"
"861","John 11:46 
 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. 
"
"862","John 11:51 
 And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; 
"
"863","John 11:54 
 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. 
"
"864","John 11:56 
 Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? 
"
"865","John 12:1 
 Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. 
"
"866","John 12:3 
 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. 
"
"867","John 12:7 
 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. 
"
"868","John 12:9 
 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 
"
"869","John 12:11 
 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. 
"
"870","John 12:12 
 On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
"
"871","John 12:14 
 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, 
"
"872","John 12:16 
 These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. 
"
"873","John 12:21 
 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. 
"
"874","John 12:22 
 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. 
"
"875","John 12:23 
 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. 
"
"876","John 12:30 
 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. 
"
"877","John 12:35 
 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. 
"
"878","John 12:36 
 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. 
"
"879","John 12:44 
 Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. 
"
"880","John 13:1 
 Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. 
"
"881","John 13:3 
 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; 
"
"882","John 13:7 
 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. 
"
"883","John 13:8 
 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. 
"
"884","John 13:10 
 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. 
"
"885","John 13:21 
 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 
"
"886","John 13:23 
 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 
"
"887","John 13:25 
 He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? 
"
"888","John 13:26 
 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. 
"
"889","John 13:27 
 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. 
"
"890","John 13:29 
 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. 
"
"891","John 13:31 
 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 
"
"892","John 13:36 
 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards. 
"
"893","John 13:38 
 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice. 
"
"894","John 14:6 
 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. 
"
"895","John 14:9 
 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? 
"
"896","John 14:23 
 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. 
"
"897","John 16:19 
 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? 
"
"898","John 16:31 
 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? 
"
"899","John 17:1 
 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: 
"
"900","John 17:3 
 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. 
"
"901","John 18:1 
 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples. 
"
"902","John 18:2 
 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples. 
"
"903","John 18:4 
 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye? 
"
"904","John 18:5 
 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them. 
"
"905","John 18:7 
 Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. 
"
"906","John 18:8 
 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way: 
"
"907","John 18:11 
 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? 
"
"908","John 18:12 
 Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him, 
"
"909","John 18:15 
 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest. 
"
"910","John 18:19 
 The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine. 
"
"911","John 18:20 
 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. 
"
"912","John 18:22 
 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? 
"
"913","John 18:23 
 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? 
"
"914","John 18:28 
 Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. 
"
"915","John 18:32 
 That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die. 
"
"916","John 18:33 
 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? 
"
"917","John 18:34 
 Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me? 
"
"918","John 18:36 
 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. 
"
"919","John 18:37 
 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. 
"
"920","John 19:1 
 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. 
"
"921","John 19:5 
 Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man! 
"
"922","John 19:9 
 And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. 
"
"923","John 19:11 
 Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin. 
"
"924","John 19:13 
 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. 
"
"925","John 19:16 
 Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away. 
"
"926","John 19:18 
 Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. 
"
"927","John 19:19 
 And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
"
"928","John 19:20 
 This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. 
"
"929","John 19:23 
 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. 
"
"930","John 19:25 
 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. 
"
"931","John 19:26 
 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son! 
"
"932","John 19:28 
 After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. 
"
"933","John 19:30 
 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. 
"
"934","John 19:33 
 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: 
"
"935","John 19:38 
 And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus. 
"
"936","John 19:39 
 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. 
"
"937","John 19:40 
 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. 
"
"938","John 19:42 
 There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand. 
"
"939","John 20:2 
 Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. 
"
"940","John 20:12 
 And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 
"
"941","John 20:14 
 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. 
"
"942","John 20:15 
 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. 
"
"943","John 20:16 
 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. 
"
"944","John 20:17 
 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. 
"
"945","John 20:19 
 Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. 
"
"946","John 20:21 
 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. 
"
"947","John 20:24 
 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 
"
"948","John 20:26 
 And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. 
"
"949","John 20:29 
 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. 
"
"950","John 20:30 
 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: 
"
"951","John 20:31 
 But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name. 
"
"952","John 21:1 
 After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself. 
"
"953","John 21:4 
 But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. 
"
"954","John 21:5 
 Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. 
"
"955","John 21:7 
 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea. 
"
"956","John 21:10 
 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. 
"
"957","John 21:12 
 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. 
"
"958","John 21:13 
 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise. 
"
"959","John 21:14 
 This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead. 
"
"960","John 21:15 
 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. 
"
"961","John 21:17 
 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep. 
"
"962","John 21:20 
 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? 
"
"963","John 21:21 
 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? 
"
"964","John 21:22 
 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me. 
"
"965","John 21:23 
 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? 
"
"966","John 21:25 
 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen. 
"
"967","Acts 1:1 
 The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, 
"
"968","Acts 1:11 
 Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. 
"
"969","Acts 1:14 
 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren. 
"
"970","Acts 1:16 
 Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.

"
"972","Acts 2:22

 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: 
"
"979","Acts 3:26

"981","Acts 4:10

"
"982","Acts 4:13 
 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. 
"
"983","Acts 4:18 
 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. 
"
"984","Acts 4:27

 Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: 
"
"1038","Romans 1:7 
 To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel. 
"
"1041","Romans 3:22 
 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 
"
"1042","Romans 3:24 
 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 
"
"1043","Romans 3:26

 That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost. 
"
"1065","Romans 15:17 
 I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God. 
"
"1066","Romans 15:30 
 Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me; 
"
"1067","Romans 16:3 
 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus: 
"
"1068","Romans 16:18

 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. 
"
"1071","Romans 16:25

"
"1072","Romans 16:27 
 To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen. 
"
"1073","1 Corinthians 1:1

"1074","1 Corinthians 1:2 
 Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's: 
"
"1075","1 Corinthians 1:3 
 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
"
"1076","1 Corinthians 1:4 
 I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; 
"
"1077","1 Corinthians 1:7 
 So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
"
"1078","1 Corinthians 1:8 
 Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
"
"1079","1 Corinthians 1:9 
 God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. 
"
"1080","1 Corinthians 1:10 
 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. 
"
"1081","1 Corinthians 1:30 
 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: 
"
"1082","1 Corinthians 2:2 
 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. 
"
"1083","1 Corinthians 3:11 
 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
"
"1084","1 Corinthians 4:15 
 For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. 
"
"1085","1 Corinthians 5:4 
 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
"
"1086","1 Corinthians 5:5 
 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
"
"1087","1 Corinthians 6:11 
 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. 
"
"1088","1 Corinthians 8:6 
 But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. 
"
"1089","1 Corinthians 9:1 
 Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? 
"
"1090","1 Corinthians 11:23 
 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: 
"
"1091","1 Corinthians 12:3 
 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. 
"
"1092","1 Corinthians 15:31 
 I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. 
"
"1093","1 Corinthians 15:57 
 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
"
"1094","1 Corinthians 16:22 
 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha. 
"
"1095","1 Corinthians 16:23 
 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
"
"1096","1 Corinthians 16:24 
 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. 
"
"1097","2 Corinthians 1:1 
 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia: 
"
"1098","2 Corinthians 1:2 
 Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
"
"1099","2 Corinthians 1:3 
 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; 
"
"1100","2 Corinthians 1:14 
 As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
"
"1101","2 Corinthians 1:19 
 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. 
"
"1102","2 Corinthians 4:5 
 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. 
"
"1103","2 Corinthians 4:6 
 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. 
"
"1104","2 Corinthians 4:10 
 Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. 
"
"1105","2 Corinthians 4:11 
 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. 
"
"1106","2 Corinthians 4:14 
 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. 
"
"1107","2 Corinthians 5:18 
 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; 
"
"1108","2 Corinthians 8:9 
 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. 
"
"1109","2 Corinthians 11:4 
 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. 
"
"1110","2 Corinthians 11:31 
 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. 
"
"1111","2 Corinthians 13:5 
 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? 
"
"1112","2 Corinthians 13:14 
 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen. 
"
"1113","Galatians 1:1 
 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) 
"
"1114","Galatians 1:3 
 Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, 
"
"1115","Galatians 1:12 
 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. 
"
"1116","Galatians 2:4 
 And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: 
"
"1117","Galatians 2:16 
 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. 
"
"1118","Galatians 3:1 
 O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? 
"
"1119","Galatians 3:14 
 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 
"
"1120","Galatians 3:22 
 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. 
"
"1121","Galatians 3:26 
 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. 
"
"1122","Galatians 3:28 
 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. 
"
"1123","Galatians 4:14 
 And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. 
"
"1124","Galatians 5:6 
 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. 
"
"1125","Galatians 6:14 
 But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. 
"
"1126","Galatians 6:15 
 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. 
"
"1127","Galatians 6:17 
 From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. 
"
"1128","Galatians 6:18 
 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. 
"
"1129","Ephesians 1:1 
 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: 
"
"1130","Ephesians 1:2 
 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
"
"1131","Ephesians 1:3 
 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: 
"
"1132","Ephesians 1:5 
 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 
"
"1133","Ephesians 1:15 
 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, 
"
"1134","Ephesians 1:17 
 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: 
"
"1135","Ephesians 2:6 
 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: 
"
"1136","Ephesians 2:7 
 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. 
"
"1137","Ephesians 2:10 
 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. 
"
"1138","Ephesians 2:13 
 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. 
"
"1139","Ephesians 2:20 
 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; 
"
"1140","Ephesians 3:1 
 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, 
"
"1141","Ephesians 3:9 
 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: 
"
"1142","Ephesians 3:11 
 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: 
"
"1143","Ephesians 3:14 
 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
"
"1144","Ephesians 3:21 
 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen. 
"
"1145","Ephesians 4:21 
 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: 
"
"1146","Ephesians 5:20 
 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
"
"1147","Ephesians 6:23 
 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
"
"1148","Ephesians 6:24 
 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen. 
"
"1149","Philippians 1:1 
 Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: 
"
"1150","Philippians 1:2 
 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
"
"1151","Philippians 1:6 
 Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: 
"
"1152","Philippians 1:8 
 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. 
"
"1153","Philippians 1:11 
 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. 
"
"1154","Philippians 1:19 
 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
"
"1155","Philippians 1:26 
 That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again. 
"
"1156","Philippians 2:5 
 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 
"
"1157","Philippians 2:10 
 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; 
"
"1158","Philippians 2:11 
 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 
"
"1159","Philippians 2:19 
 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. 
"
"1160","Philippians 2:21 
 For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's. 
"
"1161","Philippians 3:3 
 For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. 
"
"1162","Philippians 3:8 
 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, 
"
"1163","Philippians 3:12 
 Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. 
"
"1164","Philippians 3:14 
 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. 
"
"1165","Philippians 3:20 
 For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: 
"
"1166","Philippians 4:7 
 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. 
"
"1167","Philippians 4:19 
 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. 
"
"1168","Philippians 4:21 
 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you. 
"
"1169","Philippians 4:23 
 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

"
"1172","Colossians 1:3 
 We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,

 As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: 
"

 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come. 
"
"1181","1 Thessalonians 2:14 
 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: 
"
"1182","1 Thessalonians 2:15 
 Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men: 
"
"1183","1 Thessalonians 2:19

 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us. 
"
"1202","2 Thessalonians 3:12 
 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
