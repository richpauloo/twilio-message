"
"Matthew 26:55 
 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. 
"
"Matthew 26:57

"
"Matthew 26:63

"
"Matthew 27:17

"
"Matthew 27:22 
 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified. 
"
"Matthew 27:26

 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. 
"
"John 2:11 
 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. 
"
"John 2:13 
 And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
"
"John 2:19 
 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. 
"
"John 2:22 
 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. 
"
"John 2:24 
 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, 
"
"John 3:2 
 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. 
"
"John 3:3 
 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. 
"
"John 3:5 
 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 
"
"John 3:10 
 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? 
"
"John 3:22 
 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. 
"
"John 4:1 
 When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, 
"
"John 4:2 
 (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) 
"
"John 4:6 
 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. 
"
"John 4:7 
 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. 
"
"John 4:10 
 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. 
"
"John 4:13 
 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 
"
"John 4:16 
 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 
"
"John 4:17 
 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: 
"
"John 4:21 
 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. 
"
"John 4:26 
 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. 
"
"John 4:34 
 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. 
"
"John 4:44 
 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. 
"
"John 4:46 
 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. 
"
"John 4:47 
 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. 
"
"John 4:48 
 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. 
"
"John 4:50 
 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. 
"
"John 4:53 
 So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. 
"
"John 4:54 
 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee. 
"
"John 5:1 
 After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
"
"John 5:6 
 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? 
"
"John 5:8 
 Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. 
"
"John 5:13 
 And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. 
"
"John 5:14 
 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. 
"
"John 5:15 
 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. 
"
"John 5:16 
 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. 
"
"John 5:17 
 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. 
"
"John 5:19 
 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. 
"
"John 6:1 
 After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. 
"
"John 6:3 
 And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. 
"
"John 6:5 
 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? 
"
"John 6:10 
 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. 
"
"John 6:11 
 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. 
"
"John 6:14 
 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world. 
"
"John 6:15 
 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone. 
"
"John 6:17 
 And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. 
"
"John 6:19 
 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid. 
"
"John 6:22 
 The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone; 
"
"John 6:24 
 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus. 
"
"John 6:26 
 Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. 
"
"John 6:29 
 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. 
"
"John 6:32 
 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. 
"
"John 6:35 
 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. 
"
"John 6:42 
 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven? 
"
"John 6:43 
 Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves. 
"
"John 6:53 
 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. 
"
"John 6:61 
 When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you? 
"
"John 6:64 
 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. 
"
"John 6:67 
 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? 
"
"John 6:70 
 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? 
"
"John 7:1 
 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. 
"
"John 7:6 
 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. 
"
"John 7:14 
 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. 
"
"John 7:16 
 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. 
"
"John 7:21 
 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. 
"
"John 7:28 
 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. 
"
"John 7:33 
 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. 
"
"John 7:37 
 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. 
"
"John 7:39 
 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) 
"
"John 7:50 
 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) 
"
"John 8:1 
 Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 
"
"John 8:6 
 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. 
"
"John 8:9 
 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. 
"
"John 8:10 
 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? 
"
"John 8:11 
 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. 
"
"John 8:12 
 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 
"
"John 8:14 
 Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. 
"
"John 8:19 
 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. 
"
"John 8:20 
 These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come. 
"
"John 8:21 
 Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. 
"
"John 8:25 
 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning. 
"
"John 8:28 
 Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. 
"
"John 8:31 
 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; 
"
"John 8:34 
 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. 
"
"John 8:39 
 They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. 
"
"John 8:42 
 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. 
"
"John 8:49 
 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. 
"
"John 8:54 
 Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: 
"
"John 8:58 
 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. 
"
"John 8:59 
 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by. 
"
"John 9:1 
 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. 
"
"John 9:3 
 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. 
"
"John 9:11 
 He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. 
"
"John 9:14 
 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. 
"
"John 9:35 
 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? 
"
"John 9:37 
 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. 
"
"John 9:39 
 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. 
"
"John 9:41 
 Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth. 
"
"John 10:6 
 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. 
"
"John 10:7 
 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. 
"
"John 10:23 
 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. 
"
"John 10:25 
 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. 
"
"John 10:32 
 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? 
"
"John 10:34 
 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? 
"
"John 11:4 
 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. 
"
"John 11:5 
 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. 
"
"John 11:9 
 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. 
"
"John 11:13 
 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. 
"
"John 11:14 
 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. 
"
"John 11:17 
 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. 
"
"John 11:20 
 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. 
"
"John 11:21 
 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 
"
"John 11:23 
 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. 
"
"John 11:25 
 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: 
"
"John 11:30 
 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. 
"
"John 11:32 
 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 
"
"John 11:33 
 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled. 
"
"John 11:35 
 Jesus wept. 
"
"John 11:38 
 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. 
"
"John 11:39 
 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days. 
"
"John 11:40 
 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? 
"
"John 11:41 
 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. 
"
"John 11:44 
 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. 
"
"John 11:45 
 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him. 
"
"John 11:46 
 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. 
"
"John 11:51 
 And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; 
"
"John 11:54 
 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. 
"
"John 11:56 
 Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? 
"
"John 12:1 
 Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. 
"
"John 12:3 
 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. 
"
"John 12:7 
 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. 
"
"John 12:9 
 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 
"
"John 12:11 
 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. 
"
"John 12:12 
 On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
"
"John 12:14 
 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, 
"
"John 12:16 
 These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. 
"
"John 12:21 
 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. 
"
"John 12:22 
 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. 
"
"John 12:23 
 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. 
"
"John 12:30 
 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. 
"
"John 12:35 
 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. 
"
"John 12:36 
 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. 
"
"John 12:44 
 Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. 
"
"John 13:1 
 Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. 
"
"John 13:3 
 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; 
"
"John 13:7 
 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. 
"
"John 13:8 
 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. 
"
"John 13:10 
 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. 
"
"John 13:21 
 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 
"
"John 13:23 
 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 
"
"John 13:25 
 He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? 
"
"John 13:26 
 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. 
"
"John 13:27 
 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. 
"
"John 13:29 
 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. 
"
"John 13:31 
 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 
"
"John 13:36 
 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards. 
"
"John 13:38 
 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice. 
"
"John 14:6 
 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. 
"
"John 14:9 
 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? 
"
"John 14:23 
 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. 
"
"John 16:19 
 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? 
"
"John 16:31 
 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? 
"
"John 17:1 
 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: 
"
"John 17:3 
 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. 
"
"John 18:1 
 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples. 
"
"John 18:2 
 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples. 
"
"John 18:4 
 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye? 
"
"John 18:5 
 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them. 
"
"John 18:7 
 Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. 
"
"John 18:8 
 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way: 
"
"John 18:11 
 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? 
"
"John 18:12 
 Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him, 
"
"John 18:15 
 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest. 
"
"John 18:19 
 The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine. 
"
"John 18:20 
 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. 
"
"John 18:22 
 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? 
"
"John 18:23 
 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? 
"
"John 18:28 
 Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. 
"
"John 18:32 
 That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die. 
"
"John 18:33 
 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? 
"
"John 18:34 
 Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me? 
"
"John 18:36 
 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. 
"
"John 18:37 
 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. 
"
"John 19:1 
 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. 
"
"John 19:5 
 Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!

"Philippians 2:11 
 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

"
"1 Thessalonians 2:14 
 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: 
"
"1 Thessalonians 2:15 
 Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men: 
"

 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?

 And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, 
"
"2 Thessalonians 1:8 
 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
"
"2 Thessalonians 1:12

"
"2 Thessalonians 3:6 
 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us. 
"
"2 Thessalonians 3:12 
 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread. 
"

 Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. 
"
"1 Timothy 1:12 
 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; 
"
"1 Timothy 1:14 
 And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
"
"1 Timothy 1:15 
 This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. 
"
"1 Timothy 1:16 
 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. 
"
"1 Timothy 2:5 
 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; 
"
"1 Timothy 3:13 
 For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
"
"1 Timothy 4:6 
 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. 
"
"1 Timothy 5:21 
 I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality. 
"
"1 Timothy 6:3 
 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; 
"
"1 Timothy 6:13 
 I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession; 
"
"1 Timothy 6:14 
 That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
"
"2 Timothy 1:1 
 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, 
"
"2 Timothy 1:2 
 To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
"
"2 Timothy 1:9 
 Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, 
"
"2 Timothy 1:10 
 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel: 
"
"2 Timothy 1:13 
 Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
"
"2 Timothy 2:1 
 Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 
"
"2 Timothy 2:3 
 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 
"
"2 Timothy 2:8 
 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel: 
"
"2 Timothy 2:10 
 Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 
"
"2 Timothy 3:12 
 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. 
"
"2 Timothy 3:15 
 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
"
"2 Timothy 4:1 
 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; 
"

 The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.

 To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. 
"
"Titus 2:13 
 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; 
"
"Titus 3:6 
 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 
"
"Philemon 1:1 
 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, 
"
"Philemon 1:3 
 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
"
"Philemon 1:5 
 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; 
"
"Philemon 1:6 
 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. 
"
"Philemon 1:9 
 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. 
"
"Philemon 1:23 
 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; 
"
"Philemon 1:25 
 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. 
"

"Hebrews 4:14 
 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.

 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament. 
"
"Hebrews 10:10 
 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. 
"
"Hebrews 10:19 
 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, 
"
"Hebrews 12:2 
 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 
"
"1 John 4:3
